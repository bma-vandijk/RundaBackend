# Solution for using the Runda model without app

You should be able to run run_runda_model with your own custom inputs and get scale predictions with the Runda model -- you can also further modify the notebook for your own project. 
See comments in the notebook for pointers on how to do this.

Get started and:

1. **Clone**
   
    ```bash
    git clone [project_url]
    ```

2. **Create venv:** 

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv ./venv
    ```

3. **Activate environment:** 

    ```bash
    source ./venv/bin/activate
    ```

4. **Install dependencies:** 

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
